# MLP-Implementation
Custom MLP implementation from scratch, without using NumPy, PyTorch or Pandas

The custom MLP and Gergen class (Turkish translation for "tensor") is implemented as the second take home exam of CENG403 from METU.
Sections of the notebook are described as follows:

The Gergen Library: Custom tensor implementation to be used for MLP implementation (implemented as the first take home exam of CENG403).

The MLP Implementation: Custom MLP implementation from scratch. Implementation ensures correct flow of gradients.

Implementation in PyTorch: The same network in section 2 is implemented using PyTorch.
